# abos
Abos is a 16-bit real mode operating system in 100% x86 Assembly.

## Compilation
In the root directory, all you need to do is run `make abos`. It will compile the operating system. The disk image can be found in `bin/abos.img`.

## Running
**NOTE**: ABOS has never been tested on real hardware, only qemu. Due to this, *I am not responsible if you damage your computer!*
